						<h3 class="tittle">ABOUT DIGHA</h3>
					<div class="about-bottom">
						<p>Digha is a seaside resort city in the state of West Bengal, India. It lies in East Midnapore district and at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal. It has a low gradient with a shallow sand beach with gentle waves extending up to 7 km in length. It is the most popular sea resort in the West Bengal.</p>
						<p>Originally, there was a place called Beerkul, where Digha lies today. This name was referred in Warren Hastings's letters (1780 AD) as Brighton of the East.</p>
						<p>An English businessman John Frank Snaith started living here in 1923 and his writings provided a good exposure to this place. He convinced West Bengal Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop this place to be a beach resort.</p>

						<p>There are mainly three seasons in Digha, namely Summer, Monsoon and Winter. Summer starts in April and continues to till June with an maximum temperature of 37 °C. Although cold wind from sea keeps the weather pleasant in this time. Next comes monsoon in July and lasts till the end of September. Digha generally experiences an average rainfall with high humidity in the monsoon season. Winter sets in October and lasts till February with a temperature range from 24-3 °C. July to March is considered as the best time to visit Digha as weather stays most pleasant in these times.</p>
<p>Visitors can view both sunrise and sunset at Digha sea beach. The sunsets and sunrises reflecting off the salty waters of the Bay of Bengal is something straight off an artist's easel.
</p>
						<p>Digha's old beach is not as wide as it used to be due to heavy soil erosion. Big stones and concrete steps are used to hold together the beach. Since it is one of very few popular beaches in West Bengal, it gets overcrowded, especially during the cooler winter break.</p>
						<P>A new beach has been develt New Digha which is about 2 km from the old beach. This new beach is not only bigger than the old one, but might be considered a better one. It is clean and well-maintained and is not surrounded by a congested locality like the older beach. The latest attraction of New digha is the Science Centre established by the National Council of Science Museums. The entire stretch of the Digha seaface from Old Digha to New Digha is filled with casuarinas plantations, which looks beautiful.</p>
                     
                     <h2 align="left" class="tittle">Places of interest</h2>
                     <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Marine Aquarium and Research Centre (MARC)</h4>
                       	<P align="left">It was established in the year 1989 during the Seventh Five Year Plan. The major objective of the Centre is to display the marine biodiversity of the region and impart its values to the common people and to carryout the research activities.</P>
						<P align="left">MARC has largest inbuilt marine aquarium in the country and equipped with sea water circulation system and advanced filtration unit. The aquarium has 24 big sized (15x10x10’) marine tanks and 8 fresh water (3x2x2’) tanks which are equipped with compressed air supply, light and regulated supply of inflow & outflow of water.
</P> 
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Lord Shiva Temple At Chandaneswar</h4>
                    <P align="left">This place is Only 8 km away from Digha the century old Temple of Lord Shiva at Chandaneswar, near Bengal and Orissa Border. During the Bengali month of Chaitra, a popular annual fair is organised here. Nearly half million people and pilgrims visit the temple.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Amravati Lake</h4>
                    <P align="left">This is a small park with a lake called Amravati, where you can enjoy a boat ride. Near the lake is a Snake Farm, which is an added attraction.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Subarnarekha River</h4>
                    <P align="left">The Subarnarekha River drains into the Bay of Bengal, only 12 km away from Digha, located in Orissa-Bengal border. This is a new destination for Digha tourists.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Udaipur Sea Beach</h4>
                    <P align="left">This is a spectacular beach, almost virgin, 2 km west of Digha, in West Bengal Orissa Border. One part of this clandestine beach is in West Bengal and the other in Orissa. One enters this beach just walking or driving along Bengal-Orissa border. This beach has not been explored so far. The beach has some USPs which has to be experienced to be believed. The vegetation, typical of slopes in Eastern Ghats and the great Casuarina atmosphere, makes this beach, a one of a kind experience. The nearby delta, where the mighty Subarnarekha merges into the Bay of Bengal, is an additional attraction.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Shankarpur beach</h4>
                    <P align="left">Shankarpur is a beach village in East Medinipur district of West Bengal. Shankarpur is about 185 km from Kolkata and is touted to have the best beach In Eastern India. Shankarpur, a virgin beach as yet, is a recent discovery. It is a twin beach of Digha, around 14 km from Digha, along the Digha-Contai Road. Shankarpur has to its credit all the advantages of Digha, minus the crowd. Casuarina groves by the side of a gentle sea and good climate round the year make it a popular beach destination.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Talsari</h4>
                    <P align="left">The name Talasari is derived from the two words Tala (meaning Palm) and Sari/Sarani (meaning row). The palm trees surrounding the place give such a name to it. Talasari is one of the less exploited West Bengal beaches. Talsari is located close to both the Subarnarekha River and the sea. It is some 6 km from Digha, near the Orissa-Bengal border and is a small delta. The Talsari beach is not as frequently visited by the people as Digha. The waters of the sea at Talsari beach are not turbulent but calm and peaceful. Witnessing sunrise and sunset from a gleaming stretch of white sand is a rewarding experience. The calm ambience, unique receding waters and tropical weather all year round make it a popular destination for adventure seekers and those looking for solitude.</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Junput beach</h4>
                    <P align="left">Junput is 40 km. from Digha by bus, with a change at Contai. The place offers beautiful sea-view and lines of casuarina trees. The beach is unspoilt. Brackish water fish cultivation and research are done here by the State Government Fisheries Department. After independence, Junput was overlooked for development as a beach resort, Digha being chosen instead.</P>
					<P align="left">Later, Junput was harnessed for scientific research and industry. A centre for studies in marine biology is the nucleus for the area's sea-fish research and shark oil extraction. Junput also has a farm for breeding ducks.
</P>
                    <h4 align="left" class="tittle">Mandarmani</h4>
                    <P align="left">Mandarmani is a large and rapidly developing seaside resort village in the state of West Bengal, India. It lies in East Midnapore district and at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal. Mandarmani is connected to Kolkata/Howrah by a highway. From Contai this can be travelled through a place called Chaulkhola. Mandarmani boasts of a 13 km long motorable beach, probably the longest motorable beach road in India. This is a drive-in beach. It is an ideal place to relax, far away from the hustle and bustle of Kolkata. The sunrise and sunset are a treat to the eyes. The peaceful atmosphere brings a sense of relief to one's soul.</P>
